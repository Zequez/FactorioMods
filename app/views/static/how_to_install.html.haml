  ## How to install mods

  **The current install button is not supported by any mod manager yet, give it time.**

  After you download the mod you want, you have the following options:

  ### Factorio Mod Manager

  [Factorio Mods Manager](https://github.com/narrowtux/FactorioModManager) it's a multiplatform Java app created by [narrowtux](https://github.com/narrowtux).
  You can find [detailed instructions of how to use it](http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=69&t=13327)
  in the forum. [And you can download the app here](https://github.com/narrowtux/FactorioModManager/releases).

  Basically it creates a `/fmm` folder in the [Factorio application directory](http://www.factorioforums.com/wiki/index.php?title=Application_Directory),
  after that, you copy the mod packs to `/fmm/` and the individual mods to `/fmm/default/`

  The Factorio Mod Manager will let you activate and deactivate mods without having to manually add them or remove them from the folder.

  ### Manually

  Just copy the mods to `/mods` folder in
  the [Factorio application directory](http://www.factorioforums.com/wiki/index.php?title=Application_Directory).
