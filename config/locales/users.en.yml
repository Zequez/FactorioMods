          To verify that you're who you say you are, please [send us a PM
          in the forum with your account name](http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/ucp.php?i=pm&mode=compose&u=1553),
          and we'll shortly transfer you the management of those mods! You'll have to wait a bit though
          because the process wasn't automated! So there is this guy that will
          be checking the messages and verifying your account! Sorry!
